driving_question: "How can we build a home that stays cool in summer — without a fan or AC?"

    name: "Phase 1 - Explore"
    key: "Explore"
    duration: "~4 hours"
    summary: >
      Students learn to navigate Google Maps Street View and explore real homes in hot regions.
      They observe roof shapes, colors, and materials, identify design patterns, and sketch a
      “cool home.” This builds curiosity, critical thinking, and introduces climate-responsive design.

          - "Do you remember how hot it was in May before the rains started?"
